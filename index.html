                    The initial capital investment of <strong>$400,000</strong> from Mr. Otgonjargal Darisuren and partners, combined with subsequent reinvestments, is sufficient to cover start-up costs and initial working capital. Total investment will reach <strong>$900,000</strong> over five years, entirely from private funds and reinvested profits, without government assistance.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    A CAPEX investment of <strong>$70,750</strong> is planned for the first year, allocated for industrial space equipment, telecom, notebooks, industrial furniture, and appliances.

                <p class="mb-6">
                    TANAN LLC will contribute significantly to local communities through rental payments for industrial space.

                    A conservative calculation based on industry indicators shows the break-even point is reached in Year 1 as total sales hit 115% of the projected forecast. The initial first-year loss is easily absorbed by the initial investment, with all subsequent years forecasted to generate a positive margin.
